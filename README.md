Practicing various linear and multiplex programming using Pyomo with solvers including Gurobi, CPLEX, GPLK, CBC 


Management science is characterized by a scientific approach to managerial decision making. It attempts
to apply mathematical methods and the capabilities of modern computers to the difficult and unstructured
problems confronting modern managers. It is a young and novel discipline. Although its roots can be
traced back to problems posed by early civilizations, it was not until World War II that it became identified
as a respectable and well defined body of knowledge. Since then, it has grown at an impressive pace,
unprecedented for most scientific accomplishments; it is changing our attitudes toward decision-making, and
infiltrating every conceivable area of application, covering a wide variety of business, industrial, military, and
public-sector problems.
Management science has been known by a variety of other names. In the United States, operations
research has served as a synonym and it is used widely today, while in Britain operational research seems
to be the more accepted name. Some people tend to identify the scientific approach to managerial problemsolving under such other names as systems analysis, cost–benefit analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis.
We will adhere to management science throughout this book.
Mathematical programming, and especially linear programming, is one of the best developed and most
used branches of management science. It concerns the optimum allocation of limited resources among
competing activities, under a set of constraints imposed by the nature of the problem being studied. These
constraints could reflect financial, technological, marketing, organizational, or many other considerations. In
broad terms, mathematical programming can be defined as a mathematical representation aimed at programming or planning the best possible allocation of scarce resources. When the mathematical representation uses
linear functions exclusively, we have a linear-programming model.

Best approach to using this repository is to look through the code and have some understanding of your problem and which solver/optimizer best applies to your problem, then implement it using your own constraints, variables and objective function.
